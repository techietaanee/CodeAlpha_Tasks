# 🚗 Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the selling price of cars using Machine Learning regression models.  
It uses an end-to-end ML pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

This project is developed as Task 3 of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.
